### Introduction 
This activity demonstrates building Angular applications with multiple components, data binding, form handling, and routing. The activity is divided into two parts: a simple application to learn Angular fundamentals, and a music application to practice building a complete web application.
Skills Practiced:

- Creating Angular components
- Implementing reactive and template-driven forms
- Data binding (one-way and two-way)
- Event handling
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- Component communication
- Angular services
- Routing and navigation

### Part 1: Simple Application

**Overview**

This focuses on learning Angular basics by building a simple application with two components. The application demonstrates Bootstrap responsive design, reactive forms, and two-way data binding.
Components Created

1. **Shop Component** uses reactive forms with FormGroup and FormControl, handles form submission with event binding, displays user input dynamically using interpolation and logs form data to the browser console

2. **Info Component** uses template-driven forms with ngModel, mplements two-way data binding for quantity and product selection, includes dropdown menu with product options and features submit and reset functionality

### Features Implemented
- Bootstrap responsive grid layout
- Reactive form with validation
- Template-driven form with two-way binding
- Event handling (button clicks, form submissions)
- Data binding (interpolation, property binding)
- Component composition (nested components)
- Console logging for debugging
